# Fleamartian
An easily packaged Python program that utilizes BS4 and web-scraping to grab online marketplace details from websites such as EBay, then utilize them in a variety of ways that allow easy data mangement. A proof of concept.

Currently configured as a Discord bot that returns average price, but you can very easily gather other details and include those in your input.

# Disclaimer
Some configuring may be required to get the bot to work - currently the Procfile and requirements are likely a little outdated. Have fun scraping.
